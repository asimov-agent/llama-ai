# Project Instructions for Hermes Agent in llama-ai

You are working in a small, self-contained repository that serves GGUF models
locally via llama.cpp's `llama-server`. This file defines the agent's durable
workflow. Follow it for any change.

## Execution environment

- **Foreground `terminal` calls run on the real host** (`~/repository/git/llama-ai`).
  This is a plain macOS host with `node`/`npm`, `nerdctl` (Colima containerd),
  a gguf Python 3.10 venv at `~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv`, and a populated
  `~/models/**/*.gguf` tree. There is no separate sandbox — the host is canonical.
- Verify through the Makefile with real output. Prefer `make <target>` over
  hand-running the underlying tools so the defined gates are exercised.

## OpenSpec is the checklist of record (MANDATORY)

Before implementing/answering a work request, convert it into an OpenSpec change
in this repo and drive it with the Dockerized CLI:

```bash
make openspec-new NAME=<kebab-name>        # openspec new change <name> via the container
# write proposal.md[/design.md] + specs/<cap>/spec.md + tasks.md
make openspec-validate NAME=<kebab-name>   # must pass before you claim done
```

Rules:

- **Create/validate through the CLI, never by hand-writing the change dir.**
  The CLI runs inside the `openspec/` container with the repo mounted at `/repo`
  (RUNTIME auto-detected: nerdctl → docker). `openspec/` Dockerfile +
  `docker-compose-files/openspec.yaml` define it; `make openspec-image` builds it.
- **Every implemented step maps to a task.** Keep `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`
  as a tracked `- [ ]` checklist. **Tick each task the moment the work is verified** —
  never complete work while leaving the checklist item unticked.
- **Validate before declaring done:** `make openspec-validate NAME=<name>` must exit 0.
- **A change is "done" only after the loop gate is green** (see below). The final
  task in `tasks.md` MUST be a verification you can tick the moment the work is
  done — never a command like "run make phase7-archive" (which doesn't exist here)
  and never the loop command itself.
- **Commits are a deliberate human-gated act.** Don't commit/push unless the human
  asks; when you do, keep it a typed commit and never force-push / rewrite history.

## Git workflow — feature branch + PR (MANDATORY)

Every piece of work (bug fix, feature, tooling, docs) MUST be developed on a
**dedicated feature branch** off `main`, never directly on `main`. Work is only
merged into `main` through a **pull request**. This matches the remote's branch
protection (direct pushes to `main` are not allowed for new work).

1. **Before starting, branch off the latest `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/<kebab-name>     # one branch per change/PR
   ```
2. **Do the work on that branch** — create/update the OpenSpec change, write
   `proposal.md` + `specs/<cap>/spec.md` + `tasks.md`, implement the code, and
   tick each task as it's verified.
3. **Run the loop gate** (`make loop`) — it must be GREEN, and
   `make openspec-validate NAME=<name>` must pass, and every task in
   `tasks.md` must be ticked (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`), before the branch is ready.
4. **When all tasks are completed AND verified**, push the branch and open a PR
   against `main`:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/<kebab-name>
   gh pr create --base main --head feat/<kebab-name> \
       --title "feat: <kebab-name>" --body "Completes OpenSpec change <name>.<br>Loop gate GREEN, openspec validate passes, all tasks ticked."
   ```
5. **Never push directly to `main`.** If you need `main` updated, merge via the PR.
6. Keep each PR to one change/OpenSpec change. Rebase or merge `main` in when the
   PR goes stale; never force-push shared branches.

## Loop gate (run before claiming done — B20-equivalent)

Never report a change done without running the loop:

```bash
make loop            # runs: download-test-model -> test-unit -> test-install
                     #      -> test-health -> test -> openspec-validate
# or the explicit runner:
python3 scripts/loop_harness.py
```

- `scripts/loop_harness.py` runs the six stages in a fixed order and **fails
  closed** (any failed stage → non-zero exit even if later stages run and pass).
- **`health` stage (`make test-health`) is mandatory and end-to-end real:** it
  launches the installed `~/bin/llama-ai` with a lightweight model
  (`~/models/Qwen/8GB/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_0.gguf`, auto-fetched by
  `make download-test-model`), waits for `/health`, POSTs `"hi"` to
  `/v1/chat/completions`, and asserts a real text reply. This proves the host
  install serves a model from ~/bin.
- The hermetic gates (`make test-unit`) need no external dependency and MUST be
  green before any "done" claim.
- If the full loop can't complete, still run `make test-unit` + `make
  openspec-validate` and report their real results. Never hand-edit artifacts to
  fake green; fix the root cause and re-run.

## Makefile targets (source of truth)

Each verification step is an independent target; `make loop`/`loop-harness`
chains them all.

- `make install` — build gguf venv, write `~/bin/llama-ai` launcher, symlink
  `~/bin/llama_ai.py` + `~/bin/llama-server`, smoke-test (needs `~/models`).
- `make uninstall` — remove launcher + symlinks (keeps venv).
- `make venv-install` / `make -C tools venv-install` — build the gguf venv.
- `make download-test-model` — fetch the lightweight health-check model
  (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF` q4_0, ~340MB) into `~/models/Qwen/8GB` (idempotent).
- `make test-unit` — hermetic unit tests only (no `~/bin`/`~/models` needed).
- `make test-install` — host install tests (verify installed launcher runs a model).
- `make test-health` — **end-to-end**: launch the tiny model from `~/bin`, answer
  `"hi"` on `/v1/chat/completions`, assert a healthy reply.
- `make test` — fast suite (unit + install; health excluded from `test` — run
  `test-health` in the chain).
- `make loop` / `make loop-harness` — run the chained `scripts/loop_harness.py`.
- `make chained` — run each verification step explicitly in sequence, fail-fast.
- `make generate-requirements` — recompile `tools/requirements.in` →
  `tools/requirements.txt` (container or venv pip-compile).
- `make openspec-image|new|validate|status|shell` — Dockerized OpenSpec CLI.

## Dependencies & lockfiles

- `tools/requirements.in` (numpy, gguf==0.19.0) and `tools/requirements-dev.in`
  (pytest) are the single sources of truth. **Never hand-edit** the compiled
  `requirements[-dev].txt`; regenerate via `make -C tools generate-requirements`
  / `generate-requirements-dev`. `make -C tools venv-dev-install` installs
  runtime + dev deps into the venv.
- `.venv`, `*.gguf`, `.run.log`, `*.progress.log`, `__pycache__` are gitignored.

## Model downloads & secrets

- `hf_dl.py` reads `HF_TOKEN` from `~/.zshrc` at runtime — never store a token in
  the repo or commit one. Prefer documented example shapes in docs/tests.

## Record of work

Track progress in `agent-wiki/` as dated `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md` entries (what was
verified against the spec, key decisions, current status). Keep entries concise;
don't over-engineer.
